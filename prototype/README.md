# Project Assignment 3

This folder will contain an HTML file called index, a Javascript file called sketch, and a folder with p5 libraries. To run our program, you have to have the p5.js library installed [https://p5js.org/download/]. The p5.js library allows us to use built in functions such as createCanvas(), loadJSON, text(), fill(), etc. It makes it easy to create an artistic website. 

Our prototype, will display the top 5 tracks of an artist, that the user inputs into the search bar. If the artist does not exist, the web app will tell you that the artist does not exist. To run our prototype, just open up the html file. To get this information, we use the Last.fm API.
